Spiking is the process to find a way to crash the machine, the program send somes characteres randomly and hope find a breach.
It's just looking for something to break the program.

You can connect with netcat on the machine who run the backdoor (`vulnserver.exe`). --> `nc -nv <victim_ip> <port(default : 9999)>`

Or with the command `generic_send_tcp`
