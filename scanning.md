### Nmap :

#### Used for :

 -vulnerability scanning and network discovery
 
 -identify some devices that are running on a network
 
 -discorvering hosts and services which are online or offline and ports that they have opened
 
 -identify what version of software is running on the open ports

#### Interresting parameter:
 
 -The **OS detection** `-O `
 
 -The **Service/Version** info of an open port `-sV `
 
 -Skip if the specified **host is down or up** `-Pn `
 
 -Perform a **three way handshake** to see more informations `-sT` (very detectable)
 
 -**Perform the first Syn** of the three way handshake `-sS` (not detectable except the IBS)
 
 -Perform an **UDP scan** `-sU` --> of course, it list only the *open UDP ports*

 -If you try to perform an nmap on a machine that just allows Syn bitset of its internal network, you can **bypass this by send the last ACK bitset** with `-sA`. The machine thinks that you have already send the Syn bitset in the TCP packets.
 
 -Specify the **source port** `-g <source_port>`
 
 -Specify the **length of the packet** sends by nmap `--data-length <...>` (Nmap sending by default the same packet length every time and a administrator can block every packet with this particular size)
 
 -**Spoof mac address** `--spoof-mac <mac_address>`

 -**Use script** located in */usr/share/nmap/scripts/* `--script=<script_name>` (ssh-brute.nse ...)

 Scripts which have "vul" in their names refers to a certain vulnerability. The date is also include in theirs names. In order to get more scripts --> vulscan github, vulners github...  
 
```
nmap -sV <host>     // version of services
nmap -O <host>      // OS detection
nmap -p <host>      // port range
nmap -Pn <host>     // treat host as online
nmap -A <host>      // OS detection, version, script, traceroute
nmap -sT <host>     // full TCP handshake
nmap -sS <host>     // SYN sent to target
nmap -sU <host>     // UDP scan
nmap -sA <host>     // last ACK sent to target
    
nmap --spoof-mac <mac> <host>   //spoof mac
    
nmap --script <scipt-name> <host> --> /usr/share/nmap/scripts
    
ssh-brute.nse --> SSH bruteforce script
    
nmap --script vulscan,nmap-vulners -sV -Pn <host>
    
script http-methods.nse --> scan methods (GET, POST, ...)
```

### Zenmap :
 Graphical interface for nmapping

### Curl :
 `curl ipinfo.io/<ip_adress>` --> get some informations (location for example) of a server.

### Amap : 
 Another tool for scanning like nmap tool
