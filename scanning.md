Nmap :
	Uses for :
		-vulnerability scanning and network discovery
		-identify some devices that are running on a network
		-discorvering hosts and services which are online or offline and ports that they have opened
		-identify what version of software is running on the open ports

	Interresting :
		-The OS detection < -0 >
		-The Service/Version info of an open port < -sV >
		-Skip if the specified host is down or up < -Pn >
		-Perform a three way handshake to see more informations < -sT > (very detectable)
		-Perform the first Syn of the three way handshake < -sS > (not detectable except the IBS)
		-Perform an UDP scan < -sU > --> of course, it list only the open UDP ports

		-If you try to perform an nmap on a machine that just allows Syn bitset of its internal network, you can bypass this by send the last ACK bitset with < -sA >. The machine
		thinks that you have already send the Syn bitset in the TCP packets.
		-Specify the source port < -g <source_port> >
		-Specify the length of the packet sends by nmap < --data-length <...> > (Nmap sending by default the same packet length every time and a administrator can block every packet with
		this particular size)
		-Spoof mac address < --spoof-mac <mac_address>>

		-Use script located in /usr/share/nmap/scripts/ < --script=<script_name> > (ssh-brute.nse ...)
		Scripts which have "vul" in their names refers to a certain vulnerability. The date is also include in theirs names. In order to get more scripts --> vulscan github, vulners github...  
		
Zenmap :
	Graphical interface for nmapping


Curl :
	-curl ipinfo.io/<ip_adress> --> get some informations (location for example) of a server.

Amap : 
	Another tool for scanning like nmap tool
